## About

**Secure, Fast and Rusty!** It's what I'm trying to achieve with this project.

F.C.C is a project for **learn** more about Rust and encryption,
so I've done everything from scratch (ok I use the crate *log* and *log4rs* but I don't think that counts :) ).

I've started this project the 29/01/2024, and **the project is paused**, so it's not finished yet.

I've also tried to make the code as clean and readable as possible with some documentation
, so I hope you like it.
